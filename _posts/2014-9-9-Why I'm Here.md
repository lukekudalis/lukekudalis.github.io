## Why I'm Here
I started my college career at UIC where I got most of my gen eds done. After that I transferred to Columbia to concentrate on Marketing. After taking the Digital Image Design class I became very interested in Web Design, and decided to minor in Web Development. So here I am in Emergent Web Technoloies which feels a bit over my head.
 
Although my web development classes are a little overwhelming I have a feeling it will be worth it. The combination of Marketing and IT has huge advantages. For instance in my Technology for Marketing class we used Nielsen's database "Spectra" to analyze and target market segments. The Spectra database does not provide any affordences to make it user-friendly. I know what I would do to make the database easier to use but don't have the technical skills to program it yet.
